LESSONS:
- in short: this is HOW NOT TO realize the idea of resistance training
- it's HOW NOT TO DO a massive challenge to catalyze your learning endeavors
- it's really about the importance of starting assumptions of any process

- my starting assumption was: JUST GO GOGOGOGOGOGOGOGO GOG OGOGOGO FIRE ACTION GOGOGOGOGOGOOGOGOGOGOGOGOG ACTION MORE ACTION GGOGOOGOGGOOG FIRE ACTION GOGOGOOGOG
- and that ultimately, I would learn whatever I needed to learn that way
- NOPE. that DOES NOT work. 

- It's an example of a closed feedback-loop - where something's just out of feedback range, and as a result, entire process can be literally a tree grown in a big pile of clouds high above - and look absolutely real - because what tunnel vision on make-believe of the original belief, which remains out of feedback range

This app is nonsense.
Everything about this app, and also about it as a training challenge, is a lesson on "HOW NOT TO".

That was NOT time-cost-effective learning campaign.
It's a phenomenal example of what NOT to do.

Still, I entered a land of struggling within struggling within struggling, and did SOMETHING.

BUT.

This project was many-months, absolute, complete and utter failure.

I crashed so hard with this project.
It was an utter, unbelievable, total, abysmal failure.
If you want to learn by picking on a massively-over-your-current-level challenge, this is how NOT to do that. 

Why the heck put it in the pinned tabs, then?

A failure is not a failure. 
It's only a failure if one does not extract, gather and learn from it. 
Failures are a goldmine of lessons.

The only failure is to either fail too hard and knock yourself out, or to not learn from failures. 

Process-first > results. Longer-term results > results of any results-focused approach.
However, that's only true if someone confronts reality - directly, fully, no nonsense, no slack given, just full on honesty to oneself.

I'm sharing a bit of that below.

KNOCK, KNOCK.
The reality of that project is that it was an insane, time-wasting, massively misguided learning and training endeavor. 
It was a complete and utter failure, time-wise and time-cost-effectiveness-wise, and an extremely painful one.
I was absolutely NOT in a position where anything could take too long. 

And here I was.
Obsessed.
I wanted my project done. 
I believed. 
The fighter in me didn't care.

So naive. 
Persistance is cool but all of that was just so insanely wrong. 
It was just so completely and utterly misguided.

That was just so completely and utterly misguided and naive by me.
I just had some very wrong starting assumptions.

About how the learning process and training, and practice, and reps, and all that, really works.

PROJECT SUMMARY:
- extremely time-cost-ineffective. If you drew a worth-it graph, f(x) -> y ...I don't care what I tried to do, with the approach I had, I would not be training effectively. It was like a middle schooler attempting to develop muscle by lifting 250KG over and over and over and over and over and over and over, when they couldn't lift 25KG once.
- still, this is what led me to experiments, that ultimately enabled me accelerate and balance my learning rate
