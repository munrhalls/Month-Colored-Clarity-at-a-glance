I've put a constraint, for training purposes - only Javascript, ZERO HTML, ZERO CSS, NOTHING, NOT A SINGLE LINE OF ANYTHING ELSE, THAN RAW JAVASCRIPT. That's what this project is. However, it DOES have all the CSS/HTML inside Javascript. It's nothing more than that. 

Also, it's a training project and nothing more. I had way less experience back when I was doing it. It was a huge challenge at the time, though.

It can be pasted into developer tools, and it will generate entire page, styles, functionalities, drag and drop effects, and so on. It's literally pure Javascript script and nothing else.

This entire app is done with nothing other than Javascript – not even a single line of HTML or CSS. Javascript training challenge. All layout, graphics, components, drag & drop functionalities, icons, colored stylistic effects, and everything else is performed with raw Javascript and nothing else. 

App is equivalent of having a paper calendar and colored sticky notes except that days also have 24 hour columns, sticky notes can be of set hours size, and they auto-spread on equivalent number of columns in the day. For example, 3 hours takes 3 columns within a day. User can drag-and-drop these onto calendar, which matches real calendar data.

-	layout split into two: 1) colored projects, 2) 12 month calendar (carousel)
-	1) top - list of projects, add/edit/delete projects, add/edit/delete re-sizable (1-24) drag-and-droppable “stickies” 
2) bottom – calendar carousel, auto-generated from Javascript Date() interface, split into styled week rows, day blocks, with droppable 24 hour columns which respond to drag-and-drop of re-sizable color “stickies”.

This project was extremely challenging at the time but it also completely absorbed and fascinated me, as I was interacting with concepts, abstractions and ideas that felt essential to me, personally, in order for me to be able to code well. It was mostly a conceptual journey. Despite the fact that it required mega-tons of code-lines, given zero html/css constraint,
