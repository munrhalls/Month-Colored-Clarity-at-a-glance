This was a training project. 
I wanted to create an app with just Javascript and zero HTML/CSS.
(do all HTML/CSS inside of Javascript)

https://month-glancer.netlify.app

In this manner (zero html/css files, all of it in JS), managed to:
- build a calendar and colored project bars with project tiles list
- CRUD projects list and CRUD project tiles list
- drag & drap (tiles onto calendar -> week -> day -> selected hour column
- make the dropped tile expand according to its size

All of that was quite a JS exercise. Code has a ton of issues, though. Lots of areas are like an unfinished framework-attempt.
