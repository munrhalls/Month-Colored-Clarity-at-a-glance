Entire project is raw javascript file and nothing else. 
No framework or plugin of any kind.
ZERO CSS.
ZERO HTML.
Everything - every DOM element, feature, interactivity, every piece of styling, everything - is executed in raw javascript.
Even icons and svg's - raw javascript.

Frankly, it was a weird practice experiment, kind of like resistance training, that grew into hundreds of hours of very hard-to-justify, unreasonably inefficient kind of work. It got out of hand but I think it's interesting.

Idea is: entire month's time investments at a glance. Minimalistic clarity.

Top view features projects with decks of time cards. Bottom view is monthly schedule. User can play cards of time upon the board of month's days. Days are layered like cells of a table. User can drag & drop time cards to days. 

In effect, bottom view is entire month's schedule in what looks like colorful, simple excel spreadsheet. Top view provides for immediately seeing how big a project is timewise, and how many time cards are completed.
