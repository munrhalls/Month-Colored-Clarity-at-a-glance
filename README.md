This was a training project. 
I wanted to create an app with just Javascript and zero HTML/CSS.
(do all HTML/CSS inside of Javascript)

Lessons:
- BIGGEST ERROR: matching challenge to current level in proportion - this project was a poor training choice
- you'd never set a challenge to lift 150kg 10x at the gym if you can only lift 50kg 5x currently - that project was that

- ADAPTATION: 
- challenge choice needs to be slightly outside of comfort zone; 
- being outside of comfort zone doesn't mean being 10 000KM out of comfort zone, that's not how it works
