Entire project is raw javascript file and nothing else. 
No framework or plugin of any kind.
ZERO CSS.
ZERO HTML.
Everything - every DOM element, feature, interactivity, every piece of styling, everything - is executed in raw javascript.
Even icons and svg's - raw javascript.

Everything in this project is entirely my idea, design and execution.

Idea is: entire month's time investments at a glance in clarity.
Entire view is split into two main segments: projects and calendar.

Projects area.
Every project presents its required time blocks as a deck of cards.
Every time block is a card in that deck of cards.
Larger time blocks have a symbolic gestalt, visually larger size.
Every time block matches the color of its project.
It's very easy to see project's time requirements, assumptions, in this way.

Calendar area.
Entire month is presented in a compact manner.
Weeks are rows.
Days are cells.
Each day contains 24 columns to represent day's hours.

Now, the time block cards from the projects area can dragged & dropped into any day.
When time block is dropped into day, it becomes the shape that explicitly, visually matches its numer of hours.
The number of hours is transposed onto number of columns in that day, that the time block takes.
The time block retains its color match with the project.

That's it.

In effect, the user can easily see month's overall
projects and time blocks, 
time blocks / project, 
and visual schedule distribution of different project's time blocks on the calendar.
