This is the original idea from the raw javascript, zero html and zero css practice experiment.

Idea is: entire month's time investments at a glance. Minimalistic clarity.

Top view features projects with decks of time cards. Bottom view is monthly schedule. User can play cards of time upon the board of month's days. Days are layered like cells of a table. User can drag & drop time cards to days. 

In effect, bottom view is entire month's schedule in what looks like colorful, simple excel spreadsheet. Top view provides for immediately seeing how big a project is timewise, and how many time cards are completed.
