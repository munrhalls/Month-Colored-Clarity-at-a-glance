LESSONS:
- in short: this is HOW NOT TO realize the idea of resistance training
- it's HOW NOT TO DO a massive challenge to catalyze your learning endeavors
- it's really about the importance of starting assumptions of any process

- my starting assumption was: "GO GO GO GO GO FIRE ACTION GO GO!!!"
- It's an example of a closed feedback-loop - where something's just out of feedback range, and as a result, entire process can be literally a tree grown in a big pile of clouds high above - and look absolutely real - because of the tunnel vision on make-believe of the original belief, which remains out of feedback range

STORY:
- This app is nonsense.
- Everything about this app, and also about it as a training challenge, is a lesson on "HOW NOT TO".

- That was NOT time-cost-effective learning campaign.
- It's a phenomenal example of what NOT to do.
- Still, I entered a land of struggling within struggling within struggling, and did SOMETHING.

BUT.

- This project was many-months, absolute, complete and utter failure.

- I crashed so hard with this project.
- It was an utter, unbelievable, total, abysmal failure.
- If I want to occassionally learn by picking on a massively-over-your-current-level challenge, this is how NOT to do that. 

Why the heck put it in the pinned tabs, then?

- The only failure is to either fail too hard and knock yourself out, or to not learn from failures. 
- Process-first > results. Longer-term results > results of any results-focused approach.
- However, that's only true if someone confronts reality - directly, fully, no nonsense, no slack given, just full on honesty to oneself.

I'm sharing a bit of that below.

KNOCK, KNOCK:

- The reality of that project is that it was an insane, time-wasting, massively misguided learning and training endeavor. 
- It was a complete and utter failure, time-wise and time-cost-effectiveness-wise, and an extremely painful one.
- I was absolutely NOT in a position where anything could take too long. 

- And here I was.
- Obsessed.
- I wanted my project done. 
- The fighter in me didn't care.
- So naive. 
- Persistance is cool but all of that was just so insanely wrong. 
- It was just so completely and utterly misguided.

- That was just so completely and utterly misguided and naive by me.

SUMMARY:
- I just had some very wrong starting assumptions.
- About how the learning process and training, and practice, and reps, and all that, really works.

CLOSINNG COMMENTS:
- extremely time-cost-ineffective. If you drew a worth-it graph, f(x) -> y ...I don't care what I tried to do, with the approach I had, I would not be training effectively. It was like a middle schooler attempting to develop muscle by lifting 250KG over and over and over and over and over and over and over, when they couldn't lift 25KG once.
- still, this is what led me to experiments, that ultimately enabled me accelerate and balance my learning rate.
- more than anything, this project taught me that just putting your heart on the line, giving it your all every day very consistently, IS NOT enough - in fact, it's too much - it needs to be balanced with regularly detaching, stepping back, and just course-correcting the course; ultimately, learning well is all about making good choices from rich, true, accurate picture of understanding how things work
