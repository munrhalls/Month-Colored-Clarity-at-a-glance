Aight, lemme say a little bit of something. 

This APP IS NONSENSE.

It's an app of sorts...and it has nothing but raw Javascript in it.
It has a calendar. 
It has colored styles. 
You can click stuff and it does something. 
You can drag and drop onto the calendar month->week->day->hour columns. It'll fill it up according to size of what you drop.

THIS APP IS A GREAT EXAMPLE - BECAUSE EVERYTHING IN - AND ABOUT - THIS APP - MAKES NO SENSE.



It was a training project.
In reality, it was a massive experience of HOW NOT TO TRAIN.

Also, a massively misguided learning endeavor.
That was NOT time-cost-effective learning campaign.
It's a phenomenal example of what NOT to do.

Still, I entered a land of struggling within struggling within struggling, and did SOMETHING.

BUT.

This project was many-months, absolute, complete and utter failure.
I crashed so hard with this project.
It was an utter, unbelievable, total, abysmal failure.
If you want to learn by picking on a massively-over-your-current-level challenge, this is how NOT to do that. 



BE WARNED: LOOKING AT THE CODE IN THIS PROJECT IS DANGEROUS.

Why the heck put it in the pinned tabs, then?
I don't care. 
A failure is not a failure. 
It's only a failure if one does not extract, gather and learn from it. 
Failures are a goldmine of lessons. T
he only failure is to either fail too hard and knock yourself out, or to not learn from failures. 
I'm proud of many of the failures from which I have learned and I prize those.
There are things I really like that'd never come if I wasn't learning from those failures.

Process-first > results. Longer-term results > results of any results-focused approach.
However, that's only true if someone confronts reality - directly, fully, no nonsense, no slack given, just full on honesty to oneself.

I'm sharing a bit of that below.

BEWARE.

KNOCK, KNOCK.
The reality of that project is that it was an insane, time-wasting, massively misguided learning and training endeavor. 
It was a complete and utter failure, time-wise and time-cost-effectiveness-wise, and an extremely painful one.
I was absolutely NOT in a position where anything could take too long. 

In fact, I was in a position "DROP EVERYTHING, AND DO THAT X PRIORITY NOW OR YOU WILL NOT LIKE YOUR LIFE EXPERIENCE FOR QUITE A LONG TIME".

And here I was.
Obsessed.
I wanted my project done. 
I believed. 
No, not even that.
I KNEW (matrix, anyone?).
I knew I could do it.
I didn't care.
The fighter in me didn't care.
If anything, the ruins around me, they were all but inspiring to me.

So naive. 
Persistance is cool but all of that was just so insanely wrong. 
It was just so completely and utterly misguided.

That was just so completely and utterly misguided and naive by me.
I just had some very wrong starting assumptions.

About how the learning process and training, and practice, and reps, and all that, really works.

MEANWHILE, ANOTHER ERA OF TIME PASSED. 
Money went well beyond dry. What's he doin'? Yep. You gussed it. Still coding that mammoth.

Completing this monlithic mammoth of absurd and infinitely questionable code-meddling...well. 
Because of that I was late. And the late after being late. And then stuck that in a perpetual loop...some veeeeery interesting things began to happen.
Obviously, that project wasn't going anywhere, it was months already, I needed a job...you get the idea. 

Let's say, I became extremely resourceful. 
And I did acquire resources. 
And I just kept on with this project.
HAHAHA...well...it wasn't that funny later on...let's say, I became a much, much tougher version of myself and leave it at that.
Long story short: building materials firm...other jobs like that...you get the idea. 

LOOKING BACK, AT THIS PROJECT-FRENZY, FRINETIC ACTIVITIES:

This project, man, talk about being...unrealistic, to say the least. 
It's one thing to be ambitious, passionate and utterly persistent...
...it's another trying to punch holes through brick concrete with your bare hands and think that this is good training, learning and practice. 

I think you could build a city in the time it took me to do all that code Italiano pasta macaroni spaghetti's.

This project took millenial eras and then some. 

Until it didn't.
Because reality came to knock on my door, with gigaton galaxy-sized Thor-like hammers, to announce:
"you m8...uhm...I see you're doing a lot...insanely lot, that's cool but in fact...you've got your aims... a little bit wrong over there, buddy". 

This whole experience, it was a very significant chapter in my life. 
It was also one of the most important lessons: specifically, in learning about learning - how the process of learning operates.

PROJECT SUMMARY:
- most notably, I was interacting with a ton of thinking and need-to-abstract x situations
- I did some 1/4, quasi, embryon-level unfinished begginings-level framework of sorts to pull it off
- I did code SOMETHING. It is an app. It looks ok. You can click stuff and it does stuff. There are some colors.
- And it is raw Javascript, nothing else. All html/css is within JS, here.
- extremely time-cost-ineffective. If you drew a worth-it graph, f(x) -> y - I don't care what you tried to do, with the approach I had, you would not be training effectively. It was like a middle schooler attempting to develop muscle by lifting 250KG over and over and over and over and over and over and over, when they couldn't lift 25KG once.



LESSONS:
- in short: this is HOW NOT TO realize the idea of resistance training
- it's HOW NOT TO DO a massive challenge to catalyze your learning endeavors
- it's really about the importance of starting assumptions of any process
- 
- first and foremost, like that scientist David whose surname I don't recall at the moment said, it's all about GOOD EXPLANATION - HARD TO VARY and starting assumptions such that there are no starting assumptions, all starting assumptions of the process are being checked continously, all the time, always to be falsefied, always to be revised, improved

- my starting assumption was: JUST GO GOGOGOGOGOGOGOGO GOG OGOGOGO FIRE ACTION GOGOGOGOGOGOOGOGOGOGOGOGOG ACTION MORE ACTION GGOGOOGOGGOOG FIRE ACTION GOGOGOOGOG
- and that ultimately, I would learn whatever I needed to learn that way
- NOPE. that DOES NOT work. 
- 
- It's an example of a closed feedback-loop - where something's just out of feedback range, and as a result, entire process can be literally a tree grown in a big pile of clouds high above - and look absolutely real - because what tunnel vision on make-believe of the original belief, which remains out of feedback range



CLOSING THOUGHTS:
It's a great example to learn about how to not learn.

Which really, if I want to master my own, unique learning process: 
probably the most important points to learn, 
are those about HOW TO NOT LEARN. 

So then, I'm left with the good stuff. 
The stuff that you still need to order in some sensible fashion but when you do,
it's from the "DO PICK FROM THOSE ITEMS, TO INFORM YOUR OWN LEARNING PROCESS".

I realize this is a whole lot of nonsense and mumbo-jumbo talk. 
I would say that's perfect, a great match, let's pour that drink right next to the the Italiano spaghetti's code plates.

PS.
If someone reads all that - my condolences.
These notes are mostly for myself. 
These are just lessons.

You gotta code some Italiano spaghetti mammoth's composed of nothing but utter nonsense and absurd, before you can code the good stuff.
